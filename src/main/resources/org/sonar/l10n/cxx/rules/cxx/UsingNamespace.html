<p>
Using namespace directives are not allowed.

Using-directives (using namespace foo) are dangerous enough to be banned by the Google style guide. Don’t use them in code that will ever need to be upgraded.
If you wish to shorten a name, you may instead use a namespace alias (namespace baz = ::foo::bar::baz;) or a using-declaration (using ::foo::SomeName), both of which are permitted by the style guide in certain contexts (e.g. in *.cc files).
